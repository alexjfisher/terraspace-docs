- text: "Thank you for the add! I love the work you've done on the boltops apps, the documentation, visuals, simplicity, clarity, elegance of the way you think is evident in the products you have created. In a world where there is a sea of flashy apps on the front, but spaghetti code inside, just wanted to say thank you. I stumbled on Terraspace while looking for alternatives to Terragrunt and love your humility about it, that you aren't dogging it, but trying to enhance it. I recommended it to one of the teams I work with, and they are also really liking it. Anyway, thank you, and Happy Friday! From someone who is inspired by your work, and a fellow proud dad!"

You can use it for example to deploy multiple stacks at once in various cloud providers with just one command, regardless of the number and structure of their dependencies. Really impressive stuff."
