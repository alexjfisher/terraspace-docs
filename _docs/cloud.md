[Terraspace Cloud](https://app.terraspace.cloud) adds additional features and conveniences to the [Terraspace Framework](https://terraspace.cloud). It's specifically designed it work with Terraspace.

## Features

* **Dashboard and History**: When working with multiple stacks, it can become hard to remember all the stacks you or others on your team have deployed.  Terraspace Cloud helps you visualize the stacks by recording them and providing a web dashboard with deployed stacks, history, logging, and resources. Know who deployed what and when.
* **Team and Permissions Management**: Fine-grain permission control over access. You can create teams and define permission that target dev vs prod environments.
* **CI/CD Integration**: Integration with popular CI/CD systems like GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines, etc. GitHub Pull Request and GitLab Merge Request integration provide a comment with a link to the visual dashboard.

Terraspace Cloud provides these additional conveniences as an optional paid managed service. The Terraform Framework itself is open source and free to use.
