---

[Terraspace Cloud](https://app.terraspace.cloud) adds additional features and conveniences to the [Terraspace Framework](https://terraspace.cloud). It's specifically designed for Terraspace.

## Features

* **Dashboard and History**: When working with multiple stacks, it can become hard to remember all the stacks you or others on your team have deployed.  Terraspace Cloud helps you visualize the stacks by saving them and providing a web dashboard with deployed stacks, history, logging, and resources. Know who deployed what and when.
* **Team and Permissions Management**: Fine-grain permission control over access. You can create teams and define permission that target dev vs prod environments.
* **CI/CD Integration**: Integration with popular CI/CD systems like GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines, etc. GitHub Pull Request and GitLab Merge Request integration provide a comment with a link to the visual dashboard.
* **Real-Time Logging**: Terraspace captures logs that you see in your terminal and stream them live to the Dashboard. You can share this url to teammates who have access to the project.
* **Cost Estimates**: Terraspace Cloud provides cost estimates for your Terraform resources. Terraspace integrates the [infracost](https://www.infracost.io/) estimation reports with the Terraspace Cloud dashboard and Pull Request comments.

Terraspace Cloud provides these additional conveniences as an optional paid managed service. The Terraform Framework itself is open source and free to use.
