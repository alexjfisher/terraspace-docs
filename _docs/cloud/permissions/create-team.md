Now let's create a team and add the user to the team.

1. On the left-hand menu, click on **Teams**
2. Specific a Team Name like **dev** and click **Create Team**.
3. Click on the newly created team **dev**, that takes you to the team show page where you can add a team member.
4. Type in the user email and click **Add User to Team**. Note: You will only be able to add users who are part of the org. You added the user to the org in the previous step.

The form looks like this:

Once the user is added you'll see something like this:

Owners Team Note: There's a special team called [owners]({% link _docs/cloud/permissions/owners-team.md %}) that was created when you created the org. This team cannot be deleted and grants the ability to add users to the org.

Next, we'll create add permissions.
