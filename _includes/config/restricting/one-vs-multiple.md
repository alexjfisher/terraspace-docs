This is one of the benefits that come with the way Terraspace handles configurations. You have access to the power of a full programming language, Ruby, when you need it. Of course, with great power comes great responsibility.

Question: Should you use multiple files or one file?

It depends. If the configurations are small, it's clearer to have them in one file. If the configurations get complex, separating them into multiple files makes sense. It also depends a lot on personal preference.
